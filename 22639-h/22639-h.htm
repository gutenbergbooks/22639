<h3>DEFENCE OF THE EXECUTION OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.</h3>

  <p>Allow me to supply a deficiency in my last volume of <i>Extracts from
  the Registers of the Stationers' Company</i>, printed by the Shakspeare
  Society. It occurs at p. 224., in reference to an entry of 11th Feb.,
  1587, in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"John Wyndett. Lycensed alsoe to him, under the B. of London hand and
  Mr. Denham, An Analogie or Resemblance betweene Johane, Queene of Naples,
  and Marye, Queene of Scotland."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the note appended to this entry I point out a mistake by Herbert
  (ii. 1126. of his <i>History of Printing</i>), who fancied that the
  <i>Defence of the Execution of Mary Queen of Scots</i>, and Kyffin's
  <i>Blessedness of Britain</i>, were the same work; and I add that "the
  <i>Analogy</i> here entered is not recorded among the productions of John
  Windet's press." This is true; but Mr. David Laing, of Edinburgh, has
  kindly taken the trouble to send me, all the way from Scotland, a very
  rare volume, which proves that the <i>Analogy</i> in question was printed
  by Windet in consequence of the registration, and that it was, in fact,
  part of a volume which that printer put forth under the following
  title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Defence of the Honorable Sentence of Execution of the Queene of
  Scots: exampled with Analogies, and Diverse Presidents of Emperors,
  Kings, and Popes. With the Opinions of learned Men in the Point, &amp;c.;
  together with the Answere to certaine Objections made by the favourites
  of the late Scottish Queene, &amp;c. At London, printed by John
  Windet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It has no date: but it may be supplied by the entry at Stationer's
  Hall, and by the subject of the volume. The first chapter of the work is
  headed "An Analogie or Resemblance betweene Ione, queene of Naples, and
  Marie, queene of Scotland," which are the terms of the entry; and the
  probability seems to be, that when Windet took, or sent, it to be
  licensed, the book had no other title, and that the clerk adopted the
  heading of the first chapter as that of the whole volume. It consists, in
  fact, of eight chapters, besides a "conclusion," and a sort of
  supplement, with distinct signatures (beginning with D, and possibly
  originally forming part of some other work), of Babington's letter to
  Mary, her letter to Babington, the heads of a letter from Mary to
  Bernardin Mendoza, and "points" out of other letters, subscribed by
  Curle. The whole is a very interesting collection in relation to the
  history and end of Mary Queen of Scots; but nobody who had not seen the
  book could be aware that the entry in the Stationers' Registers, of
  "<i>An Analogie</i>," &amp;c., applied to this general <i>Defence</i> of
  her execution. The manner in which the "analogy" is made out may be seen
  by the two first paragraphs, which your readers may like to see
  quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ione, Queene of Naples, being in love with the Duke of Tarent, caused
  her husband Andrasius (or, as <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>some terme him, Andreas), King of Naples
  (whom she little favoured), to be strangled, in the yeare of our Lord God
  1348."</p>

  <p>"Marie, Queene of Scotland, being (as appeareth by the Chronicles of
  Scotlande and hir owne letters) in love with the Earle of Bothwell,
  caused hir husband, Henrie Lorde Darley, King of Scotland (whome she made
  small account of long time before) to be strangled, and the house where
  he lodged, called Kirk of Fielde, to be blowen up with gunpowder, the
  10th of Februarie in the yeare of our Lord God 1567."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this way the analogy is pursued through twelve pages; but, for my
  present purpose, it is not necessary to extract more of it. I beg leave
  publicly to express my thanks to Mr. Laing for thus enabling me to
  furnish information which I should have been glad to supply, had it been
  in my power, when I prepared volume ii. of <i>Extracts from the
  Stationers' Registers</i>.</p>

<h3>DE NAVORSCHER.</h3>

  <p>An idea recorded in 1841, is to be realized in 1851&mdash;which
  promises, in various ways, to be the <i>annus mirabilis</i>!</p>

  <p>In an appeal to residents at Paris for a transcript of certain
  inedited notes on Jean Paul Marana, which are preserved in the
  <i>bibliothÃ¨que royale</i>, I made this remark:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If men of letters, of whatever nation, were more disposed to
  interchange commodities in such a manner, the beneficial effects of it in
  promoting mutual riches, would soon become visible."&mdash;<i>Gent.
  Mag.</i> <span class="scac">XV.</span> 270. <span
  class="scac">N.&nbsp;S.</span></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The appeal was unsuccessful, and I could not but ascribe the failure
  of it to the want of a convenient channel of communication. A remedy is
  now provided&mdash;thanks to the example set at home, and the
  enterprising spirit of Mr. Frederik Muller of Amsterdam.</p>

  <p>We contemplate Holland as the school of classical and oriental
  literature, and as the <i>studio</i> of painters and engravers; we admire
  her delicate Elzevirs and her magnificent folios; we commend her for the
  establishment of public libraries, <i>made available by printed
  catalogues</i>; we do justice to the discoveries of her early navigators;
  but we had scarcely heard of her vernacular literature before the
  publications of Bosworth, and Bowring.</p>

  <p>As M. Van Kampen observes, "La litÃ©rature hollandaise est presque
  inconnue aux Ã©trangers Ã  cause de la langue peu rÃ©pandue qui lui sert
  d'organe." Under such circumstances it may be presumed that many a query
  will now be made, and many a new fact elicited. We may expect, by the
  means of <i>De Navorscher</i>, the further gratification of rational
  curiosity, and the improvement of historical and bibliographic
  literature.</p>

  <p>In assuming that some slight credit may be due to one who gives public
  expression to a novel and plausible idea, it may become me to declare
  that I renounce all claim to the substantial merit of having devised the
  means of carrying it into effect.</p>

<h3>A BIDDING AT WEDDINGS IN WALES.</h3>

  <p>The practice of "making a bidding" and sending "bidding letters," of
  which the following is a specimen, is so general in most parts of Wales,
  that printers usually keep the form in type, and make alteration in it as
  occasion requires. The custom is confined to servants and mechanics in
  towns; but in the country, farmers of the humbler sort make biddings. Of
  late years tea parties have in Carmarthen been substituted for the
  bidding; but persons attending pay for what they get, and so incur no
  obligation; but givers at a bidding are expected and generally do return
  "all gifts of the above nature whenever called for on a similar
  occasion." When a bidding is made, it is usual for a large procession to
  accompany the young couple to church, and thence to the house where the
  bidding is held. Accompanying is considered an addition to the obligation
  conferred by the gift. I have seen, I dare say, six hundred persons in a
  wedding procession, and have been in one or two myself (when a child).
  The men walk together and the women together to church; but in returning
  they walk in pairs, or often in trios, one man between two women. The
  last time I was at such a wedding I had three strapping wenches attached
  to my person. In the country they ride, and generally there is a
  desperate race home to the bidding, where you would be surprised to see a
  comely lass, with Welsh hat on head and ordinary dress, often take the
  lead of fifty or a hundred smart fellows over rough roads that would
  shake your Astley riders out of their seats and propriety.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p class="author">"Carmarthen, October 2. 1850.

  <p>"As we intend to enter the Matrimonial State, on Tuesday, the 22nd of

<h3>COLERIDGE'S "RELIGIOUS MUSINGS."</h3>

  <p>Some readers of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" may be
  interested in a reading of a few lines in this poem which varies from
  that given in Pickering's edition of the <i>Poems</i>, 1844. In that
  edition the verses I refer to stand thus (p. 69):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For in his own, and in his Father's might,</p>
      <p>The Saviour comes! While as the Thousand Years</p>
      <p>Lead up their mystic dance, the Desert shouts!</p>
      <p>Old Ocean claps his hands! The mighty Dead</p>
      <p>Rise to new life, whoe'er from earliest time</p>
      <p>With conscious zeal had urged Love's wondrous plan,</p>
      <p>Coadjutors of God."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I happen to be in possession of these lines as originally written, in
  Coleridge's own hand, on a detached piece of paper. It will be seen that
  they have been much altered in the printed edition above cited. I am now
  copying from Coleridge's autograph:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For in his own, and in his Father's Might,</p>
      <p>Heaven blazing in his train, the <span class="sc">Saviour</span> comes!</p>
      <p>To solemn symphonies of Truth and Love</p>
      <p>The <span class="sc">Thousand Years</span> lead up their mystic dance.</p>
      <p>Old Ocean claps his hands, the Desert shouts,</p>
      <p>And vernal Breezes wafting seraph sounds</p>
      <p>Melt the primÃ¦val North. The Mighty Dead</p>
      <p>Rise from their tombs, whoe'e[r] from earliest time</p>
      <p>With conscious zeal had aided the vast plan</p>
      <p>Of Love Almighty."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The variations of the printed poem from this MS. fragment appear to me
  of sufficient importance to warrant my supposition that many readers and
  admirers of Coleridge may be glad to have the original text restored.</p>

  <p><i>Lammer Beads</i>&mdash;Lammer, or Lama beads are so called from an
  order of priests of that name among the western Tartars. The Lamas are
  extremely superstitious, and pretend to magic. Amber was in high repute
  as a charm during the plague of London, and was worn by prelates of the
  Church. John Baptist Van Helmont (<i>Ternary of Paradoxes</i>, London,
  1650) says, that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A translucid piece of amber rubbed on the jugular artery, on the hand
  wrists, near the instep, and on the throne of the heart, and then hung
  about the neck,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>was a most certain preventative of (if not a cure for) the plague; the
  profound success of which Van Helmont attributes to its magnetic or
  sympathetic virtue.</p>

  <p><i>Queen Elizabeth's Christening Cloth</i>.&mdash;The mention (in the
  first No. of your 3rd Vol.) of some damasked linen which belonged to
  James II. reminds me of a relic which I possess, and the description of
  which may interest some of your readers.</p>

  <p>It is the half of Queen Elizabeth's christening cloth, which came into
  my possession through a Mrs. Goodwin. A scrap of paper which accompanies
  it gives the following account of it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was given by an old lady to Mrs. Goodwin; she obtained it from one
  of the Strafford family, who was an attendant upon the Queen. The other
  half Mrs. Goodwin has seen at High Fernby, in Yorkshire, a place
  belonging to the family of the Rooks, in high preservation. In its
  original state, it was lined with a rose-coloured lutestring, with a
  flounce of the same about a quarter deep. The old lady being very
  notable, found some use for the silk, and used to cover the china which
  stood in the best parlour with this remains of antiquity."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The christening cloth is of a thread net, worked in with blue and
  yellow silk, and gold cord. It must have been once very handsome, but is
  now somewhat the worse for wear and time. It is about 2Â½ feet wide and 3Â½
  feet in length, so that the entire length must have been about 7
  feet.</p>

  <p>Can any one inform me whether the remaining half of this interesting
  relic <span class="scac">STILL</span> exists; as the notice attached to
  it, and mentioning its locality, must now be fifty years old at
  least?</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Breeches Bible</i>.&mdash;The able and interesting article on
  the Breeches Bible which appeared in a late number of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" (Vol. iii., p. 17.) is calculated to
  remove the deep-rooted popular error which affixes great pecuniary value
  to <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>every edition of the Bible in which the
  words "made themselves breeches" are to be found, by showing that such
  Bibles are generally only worth about as many shillings as they are
  supposed to be worth pounds. It is worth noting, with reference to this
  translation, that in the valuable early English version, known as
  Wickliffe's Bible, just published by the university of Oxford, the
  passage in Genesis (cap. iii. v. 7.) is translated "thei soweden togidre
  leeues of a fige tree and maden hem brechis."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Effessa.</span>

  <p><i>Origin of the present Race of English.</i>&mdash;In Southey's
  <i>Letters of Espriella</i> (Letter xxiv., p. 274., 3rd edit.), there is
  a remark, that the dark hair of the English people, as compared with the
  Northern Germans, seems to indicate a considerable admixture of southern
  blood. Now, in all modern ethnological works, this fact of present
  complexion seems to be entirely overlooked. But it is a fact, and
  deserves attention. Either it is the effect of climate, in which case the
  moral as well as the physical man must have altered from the original
  stock, or it arises from there being more "ungerman" blood flowing in
  English veins than is acknowledged. May I hazard a few conjectures?</p>

  <p>1. Are we not apt to underrate the number of Romanised Celts remaining
  in England after the Saxon Conquest? The victors would surely enslave a
  vast multitude, and marry many Celtic women; while those who fled at the
  first danger would gradually return to their old haunts. Under such
  circumstances, that the language should have been changed is no
  wonder.</p>

  <p>2. Long before the Norman Conquest there was a great intercourse
  between England and France, and many settlers from the latter country
  came over here. This, by the way, may account for that gradual change of
  the Anglo-Saxon language mentioned as observable prior to the
  Conquest.</p>

  <p>3. The army of the Conqueror was recruited from all parts of France,
  and was not simply Norman. When the men who composed it came into
  possession of this country, they clearly must have sent home for their
  wives and families; and many who took no part in the invasion no doubt
  came to share the spoils. Taking this into account, we shall find the
  Norman part of the population to have borne no small proportion to the
  <i>then</i> inhabitants of England. It is important to bear in mind the
  probable increase of population since 1066 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span></p>

  <p><i>True Blue.</i>&mdash;I find the following account of this phrase in
  my note-book, but I cannot at present say whence I obtained
  it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The first assumption of the phrase 'true blue' was by the Covenanters
  in opposition to the scarlet badge of Charles I., and hence it was taken
  by the troops of Leslie in 1639. The adoption of the colour was one of
  those religious pedantries in which the Covenanters affected a
  Pharisaical observance of the scriptural letter and the usages of the
  Hebrews; and thus, as they named their children Habakkuk and Zerubbabel,
  and their chapels Zion and Ebenezer, they decorated their persons with
  blue ribbons because the following sumptuary precept was given in the law
  of Moses:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them to make to themselves
  fringes on the borders of their garments, putting in them ribbons of
  blue.'"&mdash;<i>Numb.</i> xv. 38.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">E. L. N.

  <p>"<i>By Hook or by Crook.</i>"&mdash;The destruction caused by the Fire
  of London, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1666, during which some 13,200
  houses, &amp;c., were burnt down, in very many cases obliterated all the
  boundary-marks requisite to determine the extent of land, and even the
  very sites occupied by buildings, previously to this terrible visitation.
  When the rubbish was removed, and the land cleared, the disputes and
  entangled claims of those whose houses had been destroyed, both as to the
  position and extent of their property, promised not only interminable
  occupation to the courts of law, but made the far more serious evil of
  delaying the rebuilding of the city, until these disputes were settled,
  inevitable. Impelled by the necessity of coming to a more speedy
  settlement of their respective claims than could be hoped for from legal
  process, it was determined that the claims and interests of all persons
  concerned should be referred to the judgment and decision of two of the
  most experienced land-surveyors of that day,&mdash;men who had been
  thoroughly acquainted with London previously to the fire; and in order to
  escape from the numerous and vast evils which mere delay must occasion,
  that the decision of these two arbitrators should be final and binding.
  The surveyors appointed to determine the rights of the various claimants
  were Mr. Hook and Mr. Crook, who by the justice of their decisions gave
  general satisfaction to the interested parties, and by their speedy
  determination of the different claims, permitted the rebuilding of the
  city to proceed without the least delay. Hence arose the saying above
  quoted, usually applied to the extrication of persons or things from a
  difficulty. The above anecdote was told the other evening by an old
  citizen upwards of eighty, by no means of an imaginative temperament.</p>

  <p><i>Record of Existing Monuments.</i>&mdash;I have some time since read
  your remarks in Vol. iii., p. 14. of "<span class="sc">Notes and

  Cathedral, and intend in <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>a short time to follow the advice you have
  there given to "superabundant brass-rubbers," of copying the inscriptions
  in the churches and churchyards of the hundred of Manley. The plan I
  intend to pursue is, to copy in full every inscription of an earlier date
  than 1750; also, all more modern ones which are in any way remarkable as
  relating to distinguished persons, or containing any peculiarity worthy
  of note. The rest I shall reduce into a tabular form.</p>

  <p>The inscriptions of each church I shall arrange chronologically, and
  form an alphabetical index to each inscription in the hundred.</p>

  <p>By this means I flatter myself a great mass of valuable matter may be
  accumulated, a transcript of which may not be entirely unworthy of a
  place on the shelves of the British Museum.</p>

  <p>I have taken the liberty of informing you of my intention, and beg
  that if you can suggest to me any plan which is better calculated for the
  purpose than the one I have described, you will do so.</p>

  <p>Would it not be possible, if a few persons in each county were to
  begin to copy the inscriptions on the plan that I have described, that in
  process of time a copy of every inscription in every church in England
  might be ready for reference in our national library?</p>

  <p>Perhaps you will have the goodness, if you know of any one who like
  myself is about to undertake the task of copying inscriptions in his own
  neighbourhood, to inform me, that I may communicate with him, so that, if
  possible, our plans may be in unison.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>FIVE QUERIES AND NOTES ON BOOKS, MEN, AND AUTHORS.</h3>

  <p>1. <i>Newburgh Hamilton</i>.&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me
  who Newburgh Hamilton was? He wrote two pieces in my library, viz. (1.)
  <i>Petticoat Plotter</i>, a farce in two acts; acted at Drury Lane and
  Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, 1720, 12mo. This has been mutilated by
  Henry Ward, a York comedian, and actually printed by him as his
  <i>own</i> production, in the collection of plays and poems going under
  his name, published in 1745, 8vo., a copy of which I purchased at
  Nassau's sale, many years since. (2.) <i>The Doating Lovers, or the
  Libertine Tamed</i>, a comedy in five acts; acted in Lincoln's Inn
  Fields. It is dedicated to the Duchess of Hamilton and Brandon, whose
  "elegant taste and nice judgment in the most polite entertainments of the
  age," as well as her "piercing wit," are eulogised. Accident gave me a
  copy of Mr. Hamilton's book-plate, which consists of the crest and motto
  of the ducal race of Hamilton in a very curious framework,&mdash;the top
  being a row of music-books, whilst the sides and bottom are decorated
  with musical instruments, indicative, probably, of the tastes of Mr.
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The Children's Petition.</i>&mdash;I have also a very
  extraordinary little book, of which I never saw another copy. It formerly
  belonged to Michael Lort, and is entitled</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Children's Petition, or a Modest Remonstrance of that Intolerable
  Grievance our Youth lie under, in the accustomed Severities of the School
  Discipline of this Nation. Humbly presented to the Consideration of the
  Parliament. Licensed Nov. 10. 1669, by Roger L'Estrange. London, 1669.
  18mo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The object of this most singular production is to put down the
  flagellation of boys in that particular part of the body wherein honour
  is said to be placed; and the arguments adduced are not very easily
  answered. The author, whoever he was, had reason, as well as learning, on
  his side. I am not aware of any other copy north the Tweed; but there may
  be copies in some of the libraries south of that river.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Dr. Anthony Horneck.</i>&mdash;Do any of the letters of the once
  celebrated Dr. Anthony Horneck exist in any library, public or private?
  His only daughter married Mr. Barneveldt; and his son, who served with
  Marlborough, left issue, which failed in the male line, but still exists
  in the female line, in the representative of Henry William Bunting, Esq.,
  the caricaturist. The writer of these Queries is the direct descendant of
  Mrs. Barneveldt, and is anxious to know whether any unpublished MSS. of
  his ancestors still exist. There was a Philip Horneck who in 1709
  published an ode inscribed to his excellency the Earl of Wharton, wherein
  he is described as LL.B., a copy of which I have. There can be no doubt
  he is the individual introduced by Pope in the <i>Dunciad</i>, book iii.
  line 152.; but what I wish to know is, whether he was a son of Dr.
  Horneck, and a brother of the general.</p>

  <p>4. In Clifford's <i>History of the Paul of Tixall</i>, the name of the
  real author of <i>Gaudentio di Lucca</i> is given. Every reliance may be
  attached to the accuracy of the information there given, not only on
  account of the undoubted respectability of the author, but from the
  evident means of knowledge which he, as a Roman Catholic of distinction,
  must have had.</p>

  <p>5. <i>The Travels of Baron Munchausen</i> were written to ridicule
  Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller, whose adventures were at the time deemed
  fictitious. Bruce was a most upright, honest man, and recorded nothing
  but what he had seen; nevertheless, as is always the case, a host of
  detractors buzzed about him, and he was so much vexed at the impeachment
  of his veracity, that he let them get their own way. Munchausen, a
  veritable <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>name&mdash;the real possessor of which
  died in October, 1817&mdash;was assumed, and poor Bruce was travestied
  very cleverly, but most unjustly. The real author has not been
  ascertained; but at one time it was believed to have been James Grahame,
  afterwards a Scotch barrister, and author of a poem of much beauty,
  called <i>The Sabbath</i>. Circumstances which came to my knowledge,
  coupled with the exceedingly loveable character of Grahame, render this
  belief now incredible; but undoubtedly he knew who the real author was.
  The copy in my library is in two volumes: the <i>first</i>, said to be
  the second edition, "considerably enlarged, and ornamented with twenty
  explanatory engravings from original designs," is entitled <i>Gulliver
  Revived: or the Vice of Lying properly exposed</i>, and was printed for
  the Kearsleys, at London, 1793. The <i>second</i> volume is called <i>A
  Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen</i>, and is described as "a
  new edition, with twenty capital copperplates, including the Baron's
  portrait; humbly dedicated to Mr. Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller," was
  published by H.&nbsp;D. Symonds, Paternoster Row, 1796. I had for years sought
  for an original copy of this very singular work, and I at last was so
  successful as to purchase the one above described, which had been picked
  up by a bookseller at the sale of some books originally forming part of
  the library at Hoddam Castle.</p>

  <p>On looking over a copy of Sir John Mandeville,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Printed for J. Osborne, near Dockhead, Southwark; and James Hodges,
  at the Looking Glass, on London Bridge:"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I observe he gives&mdash;at least there&mdash;no account whatever of
  his peregrinations to the polar regions; and the notion of ascribing to
  him the story of the frozen words is preposterous. I have not in my
  library, but have read, the best edition of Sir John's <i>Travels</i> (I
  don't mean the abominable reprint), but I do not remember anything of the
  kind there. Indeed Sir John, like Marco Polo, was perfectly honest,
  though some of their informants may not have been so.</p>

  was published? Of course I have seen the biographical sketch in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, the paragraph in Nichols' <i>Anecdotes</i>,
  and many like incidental notices. Steevens, who died in January, 1800,
  left the bulk of his property to his cousin, Miss Elizabeth Steevens, of
  Poplar; and as there is no reservation nor special bequest in the will, I
  presume she took possession of his books and manuscripts. The books were

  <p><i>Extradition.</i>&mdash;The discussion which was occasioned, some

  our diplomatic phraseology, must be still in the recollection of your
  readers. Some were opposed to this change on the ground that
  <i>extradition</i> is not English; others justified its adoption, for the
  very reason that we have no corresponding term for it; and one gentleman
  resolved the question by urging that, "si le mot n'est pas Anglais, il
  mÃ©rite de l'Ãªtre." I believe there is no reference in "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" to this controversy; nor do I now
  refer to it with any intention of reviving discussion on a point which
  seems to have been set at rest by the acquiescence of public opinion. I
  wish merely to put one or two Queries, which have been suggested to me by
  the <i>fact</i> that <i>extradition</i> is now generally employed as an
  English word.</p>

  <p>1. Is there any contingency in which the meaning of the word
  <i>extradition</i> may not be sufficiently expressed by the verb <i>to
  deliver up</i>, or the substantive <i>restitution</i>?</p>

<h3>MEANING OF EISELL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 66.)</p>

  <p>I must beg a very small portion of your space to reply to your
  correspondent H.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C., who criticises so pleasantly my remarks on the
  meaning of "eisell." The question is: Does the meaning <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> attaches to this word require in the passage
  cited the expression of quantity to make it definite? I am disposed to
  think that a definite quantity may be sometimes understood, in a
  well-defined act, although it be <i>not</i> expressed. On the other hand,
  your correspondent should know that English idiom requires that the name
  of a river should be preceded by the definite article, unless it be
  personified; and that whenever it is used without the article, it is
  represented by the personal pronoun <i>he</i>. Though a man were able "to
  drink <i>the Thames</i> dry," he could no more "drink up <i>Thames</i>"
  than he could drink up <i>Neptune</i>, or the sea-serpent, or do any
  other impossible feat.</p>

  <p>I observed before, that "the notion of drinking up a river would be
  both unmeaning and out of place." I said this, with the conviction that
  there was a purpose in everything that Shakspeare wrote; and being still
  of this persuasion, allow me to protest against the terms "mere verbiage"
  and "extravagant rant," which your correspondent applies to the passage
  in question. The poet does not present common things as they appear to
  all men. Shakspeare's art was equally great, <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>whether he spoke with
  the tongues of madmen or philosophers. H.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. cannot conceive why
  each feat of daring should be a tame possibility, save only the last; but
  I say that they are <i>all</i> possible; that it was a daring to do not
  impossible but extravagant feats. As far as quantity is concerned, to eat
  a crocodile would be more than to eat an ox. Crocodile may be a very
  delicate meat, for anything I know to the contrary; but I must confess it
  appears to me to be introduced as something loathsome or repulsive, and
  (on the poet's part) to cap the absurdity of the preceding feat. The use
  made by other writers of a passage is one of the most valuable kinds of
  comment. In a burlesque some years ago, I recollect a passage was brought
  to a climax with the very words, "Wilt eat a crocodile?" The immediate
  and natural response was&mdash;<i>not</i> "the thing's impossible!"
  but&mdash;"you nasty beast!" What a descent then from the drinking up of
  a river to a merely disagreeable repast. In the one case the object is
  clear and intelligible, and the last feat is suggested by the not so
  difficult but little less extravagant preceding one; in the other, each
  is unmeaning (in reference to the speaker), unsuggested, and, unconnected
  with the other; and, regarding the order an artist would observe, out of
  place.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Samuel Hickson</span>.

  <p>St. John's Wood, Jan. 27. 1851.</p>

  <p>P.S. In replying to Mr. G. <span class="sc">Stephens</span>, in
  reference to the meaning of a passage in the <i>Tempest</i>, I expressed
  a wish that he would give the meaning of what he called a "common
  ellipsis" "stated <i>at full</i>." This stands in your columns (Vol. ii.,
  p. 499.) "at first," in which expression I am afraid he would be puzzled
  to find any meaning.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>I might safely leave H. K. S. C. to the same gentle correction
  bestowed upon a neighbour of his at Brixton some time since, by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span>, but I must not allow him to support his
  dogmatic and flippant hypercriticism by falsehood and unfounded
  insinuation, and I therefore beg leave to assure him that I have no claim
  to the enviable distinction of being designated as the friend of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span>, to whom I am an utter stranger, having
  never seen him, and knowing nothing of that gentleman but what his very
  valuable communications to your publication conveys.</p>

  <p>I have further to complain of the want of truth in the very first
  paragraph of your correspondent's note: the question respecting the
  meaning of "Eisell" does <i>not</i> "remain substantially where Steevens
  and Malone left it;" for I have at least shown that <i>Eisell</i> meant
  <i>Wormwood</i>, and that Shakspeare has elsewhere undoubtedly used it in
  that sense.</p>

  <p>Again: the remark about the fashion of extravagant feats, such as
  swallowing nauseous draughts in honour of a mistress, was quite uncalled
  for. Your correspondent would insinuate that I attribute to Shakspeare's
  time "what in reality belongs to the age of Du Guesclin and the
  Troubadours." Does he mean to infer that it did not in reality equally
  belong to Shakspeare's age? or that I was ignorant of its earlier
  prevalence?</p>

  <p>The purport of such remarks is but too obvious; but he may rest
  assured that they will not tend to strengthen his argument, if argument
  it can be called, for I must confess I do not understand what he means by
  his "definite quantity." But the phrase <i>drink up</i> is his
  stalking-horse; and as he is no doubt familiar with the <i>Nursery
  Rhymes</i><a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, a
  passage in them&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Eat up your cake, Jenny,</p>
      <p><i>Drink up</i> your wine."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>may perhaps afford him further apt illustration.</p>

  <p>The proverb tells us "It is dangerous playing with edge tools," and so
  it is with bad puns: he has shown himself an unskilful engineer in the
  use of <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span>'s canon, with which he was to
  have "blown up" <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span>'s argument and my
  proposition; with what success may be fairly left to the judgment of your
  readers. I will, however, give him another canon, which may be of use to
  him on some future occasion: "When a probable solution of a difficulty is
  to be found by a parallelism in the poet's pages, it is better to adopt
  it than to charge him with a blunder of our own creating."</p>

  <p>The allusion to "breaking Priscian's head" reminds one of the remark
  of a witty friend on a similar occasion, that "there are some heads not
  easily broken, but the owners of them have often the fatuity to run them
  against stumbling-blocks of their own making."</p>

<h3>DESCENT OF HENRY IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 375.)</p>

  <p>Under the head of "Descent of Edward IV.," S. A. Y. asks for
  information concerning "a popular, though probably groundless tradition,"
  by which that prince sought to prove his title to the throne of England.
  S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Y., or his authority, Professor Millar, is mistaken in ascribing it
  to Edward IV.&mdash;it was Henry IV. who so sought to establish his
  claim.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Upon Richard II.'s resignation ... Henry, Duke of Lancaster, having
  then a large army in the kingdom ... it was impossible for any other
  title to be asserted with safety, and he became king under the title of
  Henry IV. He was, nevertheless, not admitted to the crown until he had
  declared that he <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>claimed, not as a conqueror (which he was
  much inclined to do), but as a successor descended by right line of the
  blood royal.... And in order to this he set up a show of two titles: the
  one upon the pretence of being the first of the blood royal of the entire
  male line; whereas the Duke of Clarence (Lionel, elder brother of John of
  Gaunt) left only one daughter, Philippa: the other, by reviving an
  exploded rumour, first propagated by John of Gaunt, that Edmond Earl of
  Lancaster (to whom Henry's mother was heiress) was in reality the elder
  brother of King Edward I., though his parents, on account of his personal
  deformity, had imposed him on the world for the
  younger."&mdash;Blackstone's <i>Commentaries</i>, book i. ch. iii. p.
  203. of edit. 1787.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This Edmond, Earl of Lancaster, was succeeded by his son Thomas, who
  in the fifteenth year of the reign of Edward II. was attainted of high
  treason. In the first of Edward III. his attainder was reversed, and his
  son Henry inherited his titles, and subsequently was created Duke of
  Lancaster. Blanche, daughter of Henry, first Duke of Lancaster,
  subsequently became his heir, and was second wife to John of Gaunt, and
  mother to Henry IV.</p>

  <p>Edward IV.'s claim to the throne was by descent from Lionel, Duke of
  Clarence, third son of Edward III., his mother being Cicely, youngest
  daughter of Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmoreland. Lionel married Elizabeth
  de Burgh, an Irish heiress, who died shortly after, leaving one daughter,
  Philippa. As William of Hatfield, second son of Edward III., died at an
  early age, without issue, according to all our ideas of hereditary
  succession Philippa, only child of Edward III.'s third son, ought to have
  inherited before the son of his fourth son; and Sir Edward Coke expressly
  declares, that the right of the crown was in the descent from Philippa,
  daughter and heir of Lionel, Duke of Clarence. Henry IV.'s right,
  however, was incontestable, being based on overwhelming might. Philippa
  married Edward Mortimer, Earl of March. Roger, their son, succeeded his
  father in his titles, and left one daughter, Anne, who married Richard,
  Earl of Cambridge, son of Edmund Langley, Duke of York, which Edmund,
  Duke of York, was the fifth son of Edward III.; and thus the line of
  York, though a younger branch of the royal family, took precedence, <i>de
  jure</i>, of the Lancaster line. From this union sprang Richard, Duke of
  York, who was killed under the walls of Sandal Castle, and who left his
  titles and pretensions to Edward, afterwards the fourth king of that
  name.</p>

<h3>FOSSIL ELK OF IRELAND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 494.; Vol. iii., p. 26.)</p>

  <p>W. R. C. states that he is anxious to collect all possible information
  as to this once noble animal. I would have offered the following notes
  and references sooner, but that I was confident that some abler
  contributor to the pages of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>"
  would have brought out of his stores much to interest your natural
  history readers (whose Queries I regret are so few and far between), and
  at the same time elucidate some points touched upon by W.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C., as to
  the period of its becoming extinct. Perhaps he would favour me with the
  particulars of "its being shot in 1553," and a particular reference to
  the plate alluded to in the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>, as I have not
  been able to recognise in <i>any</i> of its plates the Cervus Megaceros,
  and I am disposed to question the correctness of the statement, that the
  animal existed so lately as the period referred to.</p>

  <p>There is in the splendid collections of the Royal Dublin Society
  (which, unfortunately, is not arranged as it should be, from want of
  proper space), a fine <i>skeleton</i> of this animal, the <i>first</i>
  perfect one possessed by any public body in Europe:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is perfect" [I quote the admirable memoir drawn up for the Royal
  Dublin Society by that able comparative anatomist Dr. John Hart, which
  will amply repay a perusal by W.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C., or any other naturalist who may
  feel an interest in the subject] "in every single bone of the framework
  which contributes to form a part of the general outline, the spine, the
  chest, the pelvis, and the extremities are all complete in this respect;
  and when surmounted by the head and <i>beautifully expanded antlers</i>,
  which extend out to a distance of nearly six feet on either side, form a
  splendid display of the reliques of the former grandeur of the animal
  kingdom, and carries back the imagination to the period when whole herds
  of this noble animal wandered at large over the face of the country."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Until Baron Cuvier published his account of these remains, they were
  generally supposed to be the same as those of the Moose deer or elk of N.
  America. (Vide <i>Ann. du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle</i>, tom. xii., and
  <i>Ossemens Fossiles</i>, tom. iv.) This error seems to have originated
  with Dr. Molyneux in 1697. (Vide <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, vol. xix.)</p>

  <p>The perforated rib referred to was presented to the society by
  Archdeacon Maunsell, and</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"contains an oval opening towards its lower edge, the long diameter of
  which is parallel to the length of the rib, its margin is depressed on
  the outer and raised on the inner surface; round which there is an
  irregular effusion of callus.... In fact, such a wound as would be
  produced by the head of an arrow remaining in the wound after the shaft
  had broken off."&mdash;Hart's <i>Memoir</i>, p. 29.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There are in the Museum of Trinity College, Dublin, a very complete
  and interesting series of <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>antlered skulls of this animal. Should
  W.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C. or any other reader of "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>," desire further information on this subject, I will
  gladly, if in my power, afford it.</p>

  <p><i>Coverdale Bible</i> (Vol. iii., p. 54.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Echo</span> is quite right in declaring Mr. Granville
  Penn's statement, that Coverdale used Tyndale's <i>New Test</i>. in his
  Bible of 1535, to be quite wrong. Mr. Penn very probably took his
  statement from the Preface to D'Oyley and Mant's Bible, as published by
  the Christian Knowledge Society, which contains a very erroneous account
  of the earliest English versions.</p>

  <p>Tyndale's version of the New Testament was not incorporated in any

  <p><i>Epitaph</i> (Vol. iii., p. 57.).&mdash;The name of the "worthie
  knyght" is <i>Sir Thomas Gravener</i>, as A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. might have seen in the
  printed Catalogue of the Harleian MSS. Who he was, is a more difficult
  question to answer; but there was a family of that name settled in
  Staffordshire, as appears from MS. Harl. 1476. fol. 250. The epitaph in
  question (at fol. 28 b of the old numbering, or 24 b of the new,
  <i>not</i> fol. 25 b.) is inserted among several short poems written by
  Sir Thomas Wyatt; and the epitaph itself has a capital W affixed to it,
  as if it were also of his composition: but I do not find it inserted in
  Dr. Nott's edition of his poetical works, in 1816; nor does this MS.
  appear to have been consulted by Dr. Nott. And here I may take the
  liberty of remarking, how desirable it is that your correspondents, in
  sending any extracts from old English MSS. to the "<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>," should adhere strictly to the original orthography,
  or else modernise it altogether. A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. evidently intends to retain the
  ancient spelling; yet, from haste or inadvertence, he has committed no
  less than forty-four <i>literal</i> errors in transcribing this short
  epitaph, and three <i>verbal</i> ones, namely, <i>itt</i> for <i>that</i>
  (l. 11.), <i>Hys</i> for <i>The</i> (l. 14.), and <i>or</i> for
  <i>and</i> (l. 17.). Another curious source of error may here be pointed
  out. Nearly all the MSS. contained in the British Museum collections are
  not only distinguished by a number, but have a <i>press-mark</i> stamped
  on the back, which is denoted by <i>Plut.</i> (an abbreviation of
  <i>Pluteus</i>, press), with the number and shelf. Thus the Harleian MS.
  78., referred to by A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R., stands in <i>press</i> (<i>Plut.</i>)
  LXIII. <i>shelf</i> E. In consequence of the Cottonian collection having
  been originally designated after the names of the twelve CÃ¦sars (whose
  busts, together with those of Cleopatra and Faustina, stood above the
  presses), it appears to have been supposed that other classical names
  served as references to the remaining portions of the manuscript
  department. In A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R.'s communication, <i>Plut.</i> is expressed by the
  name of <i>Pluto</i>; in a volume of Miss Strickland's <i>Lives of the
  Queens of Scotland</i>, lately published, it is metamorphosed into
  <i>Plutus</i>; and the late Dr. Adam Clarke refers to some of Dr. Dee's
  MSS. in the <i>Sloane</i> (more correctly, <i>Cottonian</i>) library,
  under <i>Plutarch</i> xvi. G! (See <i>Catalogue</i> of his MSS., 8vo.,
  1835, p. 62.) The same amusing error is more formally repeated by Dr.
  J.&nbsp;F. Payen, in a recent pamphlet, entitled <i>Nouveaux Documents inÃ©dits
  ou peu connus sur Montaigne</i>, 8vo., 1850, at p. 24. of which he refers
  to "Bibl. Egerton, vol. 23., <i>Plutarch</i>, f. 167.," [<i>Plut.</i>
  CLXVII. F.], and adds in a note:</p>

  <p><i>Probabilism</i> (Vol. iii., p. 61.).&mdash;Probabilism, so far as
  it means the principle of reasoning or acting upon the opinion of eminent
  teachers or writers, was the principle of the Pythagoreans, whose <i>ipse
  dixit</i>, speaking of their master, is proverbial; and of Aristotle, in
  his Topics.</p>

  <p>But probabilism, in its strict sense, I presume, means the doctrine so
  common among the Jesuits, 200 years ago, and so well stated by Pascal,
  that it is lawful to act upon an opinion expressed by a single writer of
  weight, though contrary to one's own opinion, and entirely overbalanced,
  either in weight or numbers, by the opinion of other writers.</p>

  <p>Jeremy Taylor, in his <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i>, tells us that this
  doctrine, though very prevalent, was quite modern; and that the old
  Casuists, according to the plain suggestions of common sense, held
  directly the contrary, namely, that the less probable opinion must give
  way to the more probable.</p>

  <p>All this may be no answer to the deeper research, perhaps, of your
  enquirer,&mdash;but it may possibly be interesting to general readers, as
  well as the following refined and ingenious sophism which was used in its
  support:&mdash;They said that all agreed that you could not be wrong in
  using the more probable, best supported, <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>opinion of the two.
  Now, let that in the particular case in question be A, and the less
  probable B. But the doctrine that you may lawfully take the less probable
  in general is the more probable doctrine; meaning at that time the
  doctrine of the greater number of authorities: therefore they said, even
  upon your principles it is lawful to take B.</p>

  therefore the more fit to share in Cromwell's designs, and to act in that
  horrid murther of his Majesty. Upon the turn of the times, he ran away

  <p>"On Sunday was interred, in the burial-ground of St.
  Martin's-in-the-Fields, the remains of Hugh Hewson, who died at the age
  of 85. The deceased was a man of no mean celebrity. He had passed more
  than forty years in the parish of St. Martin's, and kept a hair-dresser's
  shop, being no less a personage than the identical <i>Hugh Strap</i>,
  whom Dr. Smollett rendered so conspicuously interesting in his life and
  adventures of Roderick Random. The deceased was a very intelligent man,
  and took delight in recounting the scenes of his early life. He spoke
  with pleasure of the time he passed in the service of the Doctor; and it
  was his pride, as well as boast, to say, that he had been educated at the
  same seminary with so learned and distinguished a character. His shop was
  hung round with Latin quotations, and he would frequently point out to
  his acquaintance the several scenes in Roderick Random, pertaining to
  himself, which had their foundation, not in the Doctor's inventive fancy,
  but in truth and reality. The Doctor's meeting with him at a barber's
  shop at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the subsequent mistake at the Inn, their
  arrival together in London, and the assistance they experienced from
  <i>Strap's</i> friend were all of that description. The deceased, to the
  last, obtained a comfortable subsistence by his industry, and of late
  years had been paid a weekly salary by the inhabitants of the Adelphi,
  for keeping the entrances to Villiers-walk, and securing the promenade
  from the intrusion of strangers."</p>

  <p><i>Rodolph Gualter</i> (Vol. iii., p. 8.).&mdash;From letters to and
  from Rodolph Gualter (in <i>Zurich</i>, and <i>Original Letters, Parker
  Society</i>) little can be gathered; thus much have I gleaned, that
  though mention is oftentimes made of Scotland, yet not sufficient to
  identify Gualter as being a native of that country; yet it should be
  observed that he dedicated his Homilies on the Galatians to the King of
  Scotland, <i>Zurich Letters</i> (second series) cxviii., see also,
  cxxix., cxxx. These remarks may tend perchance to put J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;R. on the
  right track for obtaining true information.</p>

  <p><i>Burning the Hill</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 441. 498.).&mdash;The provision
  for <i>burning out</i> a delinquent miner, contained in the Mendip mine
  laws, called Lord C.&nbsp;J. Choke's laws, first appeared in print in 1687; at
  least I can find no earlier notice of them in any <i>book</i>; but as the
  usages sanctioned by them are incidentally mentioned in proceedings in
  the Exchequer in 21 and 22 Elizabeth, they are no doubt of early date.
  Article 6. certainly has a very sanguinary aspect; but as the thief,
  whose hut and tools are to be burnt, is himself to be "<i>banished</i>
  from his occupation before the miners for ever," it cannot be intended
  that he should be himself burnt also. If any instance of the exercise of
  a <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>custom or law so clearly illegal had ever
  occurred within recent times, we should have assuredly found some record
  of it in the annals of criminal justice, as the executioner would
  infallibly have been hanged. The regulations are probably an attempt by
  some private hand to embody the local customs of the district, so far as
  regards lead mining; and they contain the substance of the usual customs
  prevalent in most metallic regions, where mines have been worked <i>ab
  antiquo</i>. The first report of the Dean Forest Commission, 1839, f.
  12., adverts to a similar practice among the coal and iron miners in that
  forest. It seems to be an instance of the <i>Droit des arsins</i>, or
  right of arson, formerly claimed and exercised to a considerable extent,
  and with great solemnity, in Picardy, Flanders, and other places; but I
  know of no instance in which this wild species of metallifodine justice
  has been claimed to apply to anything but the culprit's local habitation
  and tools of trade. I need not add that the custom, even with this
  limitation, would now be treated by the courts as a vulgar error, and
  handed over to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legal antiquaries and
  collectors of the Juris am&oelig;nitates.</p>

  <p>"<i>Fronte capillata</i>," &amp;c. (vol. iii., pp. 8. 43.).&mdash;The
  couplet is much older than G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;S. seems to think. The author is
  Dionysius Cato,&mdash;"Catoun," as Chaucer calls him&mdash;in his book,
  <i>Distichorum de Moribus</i>, lib. ii. D. xxvi.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Rem tibi quam nosces aptam, dimittere noli:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The history of this Dionysius Cato is unknown; and it has been hotly
  disputed whether he were a Heathen or Christian; but he is <i>at
  least</i> as old as the fourth century of the Christian era, being
  mentioned by Vindicianus, chief physician in ordinary to the emperor, in
  a letter to Valentinian I., <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 365. In the
  illustrations of <i>The Baptistery</i>, Parker, Oxford, 1842, which are
  re-engraved from the originals in the <i>Via VitÃ¦ EternÃ¦</i>, designed by
  Boetius a Bolswert, the figure of "Occasion" is always drawn with the
  hair hanging loose in front, according to the distich.</p>

  <p><i>Time when Herodotus wrote</i> (vol. ii., p. 405.; Vol. iii., p.
  30.)&mdash;The passage in Herodotus (i. 5.) is certainly curious, and had
  escaped my notice, until pointed out by your correspondent. I am unable
  at present to refer to Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography
  and Mythology</i>; but I doubt whether the reading of the poem or title,
  in Aristotle's <i>Rhetoric</i> (<span class="scac">II.</span> 9. Â§ 1.),
  has received much attention. In my forthcoming translation of the
  "Pseudo-Herodotean Life of Homer" prefixed to the <i>Odysseia</i> (Bohn's
  <i>Classical Library</i>), note 1., I have thus given it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is the exposition of the historical researches of Herodotus of
  <i>Thurium</i>," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now Aristotle makes no remark on the passage as being unusual, and it
  therefore inclines me to think that, at the time of that philosopher and
  critic, both editions were in use.</p>

  <p>The date of the building of Thurium is <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  444, and Herodotus was there at its foundation, being then about forty
  years of age. Most likely he had published a smaller edition of this book
  before that time, bearing the original date from Halicarnassus, which he
  revised, <i>enlarged</i>, corrected, and <i>partly re-wrote</i> at
  Thurium. I think this would not be difficult to prove; and I would add
  that this retouching would be found more apparent at the beginning of the
  volume than elsewhere. This may be easily accounted for by the feeling
  that modern as well as ancient authors have, viz., that of laziness and
  inertness; revising the first 100 pages carefully, but decreasing from
  that point. But to return: Later editors, I conceive, erased the word
  Thurium used by Herodotus, who was piqued and vexed at his native city,
  and substituted, or restored, Halicarnassus; not, however, changing the
  text.</p>

  <p>A learned friend of mine wished for the bibliographical history of the
  classics. I told him then, as I tell the readers of the "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" now, "Search for that history in the
  pages of the classics themselves; extend to them the critical spirit that
  is applied to our own Chaucer, Shakspeare, and Milton, and your trouble
  will not be in vain. The history of any book (that is the general history
  of the gradual development of its ideas) is written in its own pages." In
  truth, the prose classics deserve as much attention as the poems of
  Homer.</p>

  <p><i>Herstmonceux Castle</i> (Vol. ii., p. 477.).&mdash;E. V. asks for
  an explanation of certain entries in the Fine Rolls, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1199 and 1205, which I can, in part, supply. The
  first is a fine for having seisin of the lands of the deceased mother of
  the two suitors, William de Warburton and Ingelram de Monceaux. As they
  claim as joint-heirs or parceners, the land must have been subject to
  partibility, and therefore of socage tenure. If the land was not in Kent,
  the entry is a proof that the exclusive right of primogeniture was not
  then universally established, as we know it was not in the reign of Henry
  II. See <i>Glanville</i>, lib. vii. cap. 3.</p>

  <p>The next entry records the fine paid for suing out a writ <i>de
  rationabili parte</i> against (<i>versus</i>) one of the above coheirs.
  The demandant is either the same coheir named above, viz. Ingelram,
  altered by a clerical error into Waleram,&mdash;such errors being of
  common occurrence, sometimes from oscitancy, and sometimes because the
  clerk had to guess at the extended form of a contracted name,&mdash;or he
  is a descendant and heir of Ingelram, <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>claiming the share of
  his ancestor. I incline to adopt the former explanation of the two here
  suggested. The form of writ is in the Register of Writs, and corresponds
  exactly with the abridged note of it in the Fine Roll. The "esnecia,"
  mentioned in the last entry (not extracted by E.&nbsp;V.), is the majorat or
  senior heir's perquisite of the capital mansion. E.&nbsp;V. will pardon me for
  saying, that his translation of the passages is a little deficient in
  exactness. As to E.&nbsp;V.'s query 4., does he think it worth while to go
  further in search of a reason for calling the bedroom floor of
  Herstmonceux Castle by the name of <i>Bethlem</i>, when the early
  spelling and common and constant pronunciation of the word supply so
  plausible an explanation? I myself knew, in my earliest days, a house
  where that department was constantly so nicknamed. But there certainly
  <i>may</i> be a more recondite origin of the name; and something may
  depend on the date at which he finds it first applied.</p>

  <p><i>Camden and Curwen Families</i> (Vol. iii., p. 89.).&mdash;Camden's
  mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Gyles Curwen, of Poulton Hall, in the
  county of Lancaster. In the "visitation" of Lancashire made in 1613, it
  is stated that this Gyles Curwen was "descended from Curwen of Workenton
  in co. Cumberland;" but the descent is not given, and I presume it rests
  merely on tradition.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Llewellyn.</span>

  <p><i>Joan Sanderson, or the Cushion Dance</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  517.).&mdash;Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mac</span> asks for the
  "correct date" of the <i>Cushion Dance</i>. Searching out the history and
  origin of an old custom or ballad is like endeavouring to ascertain the
  source and flight of December's snow. I am afraid <span
  class="sc">Mac</span> will not obtain what he now wishes for.</p>

  <p>The <i>earliest</i> mention, that I have noticed, of this popular old
  dance occurs in Heywood's play, <i>A Woman kill'd with Kindness</i>,
  1600. Nicholas, one of the characters, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have, ere now, deserved a cushion: call for the <i>Cushion
  Dance</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The musical notes are preserved in <i>The English Dancing Master</i>,
  1686; in <i>The Harmonicon</i>, a musical journal; in Davies Gilbert's
  <i>Christmas Carols</i> (2nd edition); and in Chappell's <i>National
  English Melodies</i>. In the first-named work it is called "Joan
  Sanderson, or the Cushion Dance, an old Round Dance."</p>

  <p>In a curious collection of old songs and tunes, <i>Neder-Landtsche
  Gedenck-clank door Adrianum Valerium</i>, printed at Haerlem in 1626, is
  preserved a tune called "Sweet Margaret," which, upon examination, proves
  to be the same as the <i>Cushion Dance</i>. This favourite dance was well
  known in Holland in the early part of the seventeenth century, and an
  interesting engraving of it may be seen in the <i>Emblems</i> of John de
  Brunnes, printed at Amsterdam in 1624.</p>

  <p>The last-named work (a copy of the edition of 1661 of which is now
  before me) is exceedingly curious to the lovers of our popular sports and
  pastimes. The engravings are by William Pass, C. Blon, &amp;c., and among
  them are representations of Kiss in the Ring, the game of Forfeits,
  rolling Snow-balls, the Interior of a Barber's Shop, with citherns and
  lutes hanging against the wall, for the use of the customers, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>North Sides of Churchyards</i> (Vol. ii., p. 93.).&mdash;In an
  appendix to our registers I find the following entry, where I conceive
  the <i>backside</i> means the northside. Though now the whole of our
  churchyard is so full that we have much difficulty in finding any new
  ground, what we do find, however, is on the north side.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1750, Oct. 23. One Mary Davies, of Pentrobin, single woman, though
  excommunicated with the <i>Greater Excommunication</i>, was on this day,
  <i>within night</i>, on account of some particular circumstances alleged
  by neighbours of credit in her favour (as to her resolving to come and
  reconcile herself, and do penance if she recovered), indulged by being
  interred on the <i>backside</i> the church, but no service or tolling
  allowed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From this I conclude that <i>here</i> at least there was no part of
  the churchyard left unconsecrated for the burial of persons
  excommunicate, as one of your correspondents suggests; or burial in such
  place would have been no indulgence, as evidently it was regarded in this
  case. It would be interesting to ascertain from accredited instances
  <i>how late</i> this power of excommunication has been <i>exercised</i>,
  and thereby how long it has really been in abeyance. I expect the period
  would not be found so great as is generally imagined.</p>

  <p><i>Antiquitas SÃ¦culi Juventus Mundi</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  466.).&mdash;Dugald Stewart, in his Dissertation prefixed to the
  <i>EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica</i>, ed. 7., p. 30., points out two passages
  of writers anterior to Lord Bacon, in which this thought occurs. The
  first is in his namesake, Roger Bacon, who died in 1292:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quanto juniores tanto perspicaciores, quia juniores posteriores
  successione temporum ingrediuntor labores priorum."&mdash;<i>Opus
  Majus</i>, p. 9. ed. Jebb.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>Opus Majus</i> of Roger Bacon was not, however, printed until
  the last century, and could not have been known to Lord Bacon unless he
  had read it in manuscript.</p>

  <p>The second is from Ludovicus Vives, <i>De Caus. Corrupt. Art.</i>,
  lib. i., of which Mr. Stewart gives the following version:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The similitude which many have fancied between the superiority of the
  moderns to the ancients, and the elevation of a dwarf on the back of a
  giant, is <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>altogether false and puerile. Neither were
  they giants, nor are we dwarfs, but all of us men of the same standard;
  and <i>we</i>, the taller of the two, by adding their height to our own.
  Provided always that we do not yield to them in study, attention,
  vigilance, and love of truth; for if these qualities be wanting, so far
  from mounting on the giant's shoulders, we throw away the advantages of
  our own just stature, by remaining prostrate on the ground."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Ludovicus Vives, the eminent Spanish writer, died in 1540, and
  therefore preceded the active period of Lord Bacon's mind by about half a
  century.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stewart likewise cites the following sentences of Seneca, which,
  however, can hardly be said to contain the germ of this
  thought:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Veniet tempus quo ista quÃ¦ nunc latent, in lucem dies extrahet, et
  longioris Ã¦vi diligentia.... Veniet tempus, quo posteri nostri tam aperta
  nos nescisse mirabuntur."&mdash;<i>QuÃ¦st. Nat.</i> viii. 25.</p>

  additional facts may not perhaps be unacceptable to your readers.</p>

  <p>In Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. i. (8th edit. 1737), are these
  articles:&mdash;</p>

  <i>Ombrella</i>, Ital. of <i>Umbrella</i>, or <i>Umbrecula</i>, L.], a
  sort of skreen that is held over the head for preserving from the sun or
  rain; also a wooden frame covered with cloth or stuff, to keep off the
  sun from a window."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>, vol. ii. (3rd edit. 1737), is the
  following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Umbellated</span> [<i>Umbellatus</i>, L.]; bossed.
  In <i>botan. writ.</i> is said of flowers when many of them grow

  <p>Horace Walpole (<i>Memoirs of the Reign of George II.</i>, vol. iii.

  <p>"The man stood in the pillory, having a footman holding an umbrella to
  keep off the rain."</p>

  the sentence on Dr. Shebbeare. The affidavits produced by the

  <p>"Thoughts take up no room," saith Jeremy Collier, in a curious passage
  which Mr. Elmes has adopted as the motto of a pretty little volume, which
  he has just put forth under the following characteristic title: <i>HorÃ¦
  VacivÃ¦, a Thought-book of the Wise Spirits of all Ages and all Countries,
  fit for all Men and all Hours</i>. The work appears to have furnished a
  source of occupation to its editor when partially recovering from a
  deprivation of sight. It is well described by him as a "Spicilegium of
  golden thoughts of wise spirits, who, though dead, yet speak;" and being
  printed in Whittingham's quaintest style, and suitably bound, this
  Thought-book is as externally tempting as it is intrinsically
  valuable.</p>

  <p><i>The Calendar of the Anglican Church Illustrated, with Brief
  Accounts of the Saints who have Churches dedicated in their Names, or
  whose Images are most frequently met with in England; the Early Christian
  and MediÃ¦val Symbols; and an Index of Emblems</i>, is sufficiently
  described in its title-page. The editor very properly explains that the
  work is of an archÃ¦ological, not of a theological character&mdash;and as
  such it is certainly one which English archÃ¦ologists and ecclesiologists
  have long wanted. The editor, while judiciously availing himself of the
  labours of Alt, Radowitz, Didron, and other foreign writers, has not
  spared his own, having, with the view to one portion of it, compiled a
  list of all the churches in England, with the saints after whom they were
  named. This is sufficient to show that the work is one of research, and
  consequently of value; that value being materially increased by the
  numerous woodcuts admirably engraved by Mr. O. Jewitt, with which it is
  illustrated.</p>

  you can admire the most beautiful specimens of PAPIER MACHE MANUFACTURE
  which are produced in this country, displayed in the most attractive
  forms&mdash;if you want a handsome or useful dressing-case, work-box, or
  writing-desk, if you need any requisite for the work-table or toilet, or
  if you desire to see one of the most elegant emporiums in

  archÃ¦ological, not of a theological character; the Editor has not
  considered it his business to examine into the truth or falsehood of the
  legends of which he narrates the substance; he gives them merely as
  legends, and in general so much of them only as is necessary to explain
  why particular emblems were used with a particular saint, or why Churches
